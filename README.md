# COSC499-GitExercise
test repo for Cosc 499 assignment 1

This utility program was written in anticipation of the 310 project (chatbot) requiring such functionality.
It was written by myself before any of the team work had been completed and went largely unused in the creation
of the chatbot in question, although the modality reading feature was used to determine grammatical metadata not included
in the Stanford NLP code that we used (it is probably possible to get this data from the NLP API, but this was
not something that was evident on the project.)

edit:
added the verbose feature, which describes the phrase being encapsulated at each stage of the process in english, rather than using the symbolic markdown employed by the application.

added the automation feature to allow for multiple sentences to be parsed in one execution of the program. essentially this is just a function being called by a loop, a wrapper around the existing code that executed the program for testing purposes.

these branches were merged into the master and then deleted.
