# COSC499-GitExercise
test repo for Cosc 499 assignment 1

This utility program was written in anticipation of the 310 project (chatbot) requiring such functionality.
It was written by myself before any of the team work had been completed and went largely unused in the creation
of the chatbot in question, although the modality reading feature was used to determine grammatical metadata not included
in the Stanford NLP code that we used (it is probably possible to get this data from the NLP API, but this was
not something that was evident on the project.)
